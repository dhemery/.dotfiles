# Dale Emery's Dotfiles

## Installing

1. Read this README, paying particular attention to each **WARNING.**
1. Clone this repo.
1. CD into the repo.
1. Change the files in the repo to suit your needs.
1. run `.make.sh`.

## The `.make.sh` Script

**Links:**
The `.make.sh` script adds a dotfile link in your home directory to each
non-dotfile entry in the current working directory.  The name of the link is
the same as the name of the entry, with a dot prepended.  So the `bashrc` entry
in the repo is linked as `~/.bashrc`.

**Limited Backup:**
Before linking each entry, if the link would replace an existing entry in the
home directory, `.make.sh` moves the existing entry to the `.backup` directory
inside the repo. This gives you a brief opportunity to undo the changes it
made.

The `.backup` directory is ignored by git.

### **WARNING:** Replaces dotfiles in Your Home Directory

This script replaces dotfiles in your home directory. That is what is
intended to do. 

**Before you run `.make.sh`:**

- Identify each non-dotfile entry in the top directory of the repository,
- Identify which existing entry in your home directory (if any) would be
  replaced by each repo entry. To do this, imagine `~/.` prepended to
  each repo entry.
- Make a copy of any existing home-directory dotfile file you want to
  keep.
- Delete or edit any repo file that does not suit your needs.
- Make sure you are currently in the top directory of the repo.

### **WARNING:** Be Careful Where You Run This Script

This script is designed to run *only in the top directory of this repo.*  If
you run it in some other directory, it adds a dotfile link in your home
directory to *every* non-dotfile entry in the directory where you run it. You
almost certainly do not want that.

### **WARNING:** Links, Not Copies

The `.make.sh` script *links* the files. It *does not copy* them.  So any
changes made in the repo are reflected in the "live" dotfile, and vice versa.

### **WARNING:** Backups are *VERY, VERY LIMITED*.

Each link in the `.backup` directory is overwritten each time you run
`.make.sh`.  So each time you run `.make.sh`, the previous backup is
lost. This means that **if you run the script twice, your original
files are lost.**

## My Configuration

Here are some things to notice about some of the configuration.  For the files
I don't mention, just know that I designed them for me.  Adjust as necessary
for your own needs.

**`bashrc`:**

- Sources the following scripts if it can find them:
    - bash completion script
    - git complation script
    - liquidprompt script
- Defines bash functions for commands that I use often.
- Defines a bash function for each git alias defined in my git
    configuration.  It names each bash function by prepending a 'g'
    onto the name of the git alias.  For example, my `l` git alias
    becomes a bash function named `gl`.
- Defines a few environment variables.
- Sources `~/.bash_local` if it exists.

See the source code for details. 

**`config/`:**
Directory for configuration files.  The `bashrc` file sets `~/.config/` as the
default XDG config directory, which instructs various tools to use it to store
config information.  Some tools put lots of stuff in here, so you may need to
watch this directory and add `.gitignore` files to avoid adding them to the
repo.  

**`config/git/config`:**

- Defines a few dozen git aliases for git commands that I use often.
- Includes `~/.git_local` if it exists. Use `~/.git_local` to store
    config options that you don't want to store in this repo.

NOTE: My `bashrc` file defines a bash function for each git alias.  See the
`bashrc` details above.

**`config/git/ignore`:**
A broad list of files to ignore in **all** repos.  Adjust if this list is too
broad for your needs.

**`gradle/`:**
Gradle configuration.  Gradle writes lots of information into this directory.
I've `.gitignore`d most of it.

## Local Additions for bash and git

If your home directory contains a `.bash_local` file, the `bashrc` file sources
it before it exits.

If your home directory contains a `.git_local` file, the `config/git` file
includes it.
